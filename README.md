## Go to bed, Minty

A simple mod that replaces the "New Run" button on the victory and defeat screens with a "QUIT" button, so you don't succumb to the "just one more run" disease and ruin your sleep schedule again.

Can activate on win (default on) and/or lose (default off). Can also set a bedtime (default on and 22:00-8:00) in which case it will only activate during the designated hours. Can additionally ban Endless Mode and remove the Main Menu button.
